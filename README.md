## Prefrontal cortical connectivity mediates locus coeruleus noradrenergic regulation of inhibitory control in older adults

This repository contains code and data to reproduce the results in the
article “**Prefrontal cortical connectivity mediates locus coeruleus
noradrenergic regulation of inhibitory control in older adults**” from
Tomassini et al., published on Journal of Neuroscience (2022) where we
combine MRI, fMRI and computational modelling to show that the integrity
of the locus coeruleus, the principal source of cortical noradrenaline,
is related to the efficiency of response inhibition in healthy older
adults (https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1361-21.2022). 
A pre-print of the article can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450427v2.abstract).

The analyes follow the pre-registred pipeline that can be found on OSF
at this [link](https://osf.io/zgj9n/). For the sake of reproducibility,
a renv.lock file including metadata and dependencies has been included
(have a look at [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for
further details).
